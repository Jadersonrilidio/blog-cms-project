<h2 style='text-align:center'> About the Project </h2>
<br>
<p style='text-align:justify'> &emsp;&emsp; The project is a simple blog where users can view the posts and leave comments, since they were registered. Also counts with a self-developed CMS system for priviledged users (so-called admin) to manage posts, categories, comments and users attributes. Also some features were implemented, as write bellow: </p>
<p> &emsp;&emsp; <b>-&gt</b> Search box, where the search is performed according to the posts' tags; </p>
<p> &emsp;&emsp; <b>-&gt</b> Notification boxes for actions and events </p>
<p> &emsp;&emsp; <b>-&gt</b> Select Language feature for all blog pages (CMS system and populate_database-related content are english only) </p>
<p> &emsp;&emsp; <b>-&gt</b> User profile editor and mail directed forgot password request; </p>
<p> &emsp;&emsp; <b>-&gt</b> Online users display; </p>
<p> &emsp;&emsp; and more... </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'> Worth to say that not all actions are enabled on this portfolio model website, as some CRUD actions, or alter the admin user attributes, as well the default categories, posts and comments. </p>

<h2 style='text-align:center'> Author's Notes </h2>
<br>
<p style='text-align:justify'> 
    <b>-&gt</b> The project layout is provided within the course 
    <a href='https://www.udemy.com/course/php-for-complete-beginners-includes-msql-object-oriented' target='_blank'>\"PHP for Beginners - Become a PHP Master - CMS Project\"</a>
    by <b>Edwin Diaz</b>. Although, most of the layout and code behind was altered, improved and added. 
</p>
<br>
<p style='text-align:justify'> 
    <b>-&gt</b> Due to learning purposes, the project has been built according to different programming paradigm, folllowing the order: 
    <p style='text-align:center'> Imperative -> procedural -> object-oriented </p>
    <p style='text-align:center'> The currently programming paradigm stage is procedural with a pinch of OOP to handle more complex functionality.
    Although, a complete OOP paradigm may be implemented on the following major release. </p> 
</p>
<br>
<p style='text-align:justify'>
    <b>-&gt</b> For learning purposes, the project was not based on a existent software design nor architecture, but created from the author's best guess of how to organize the code,
    and yet the author himself has some knowledge of commom designs and architecture to be based on, details which can be noted on the code.
    On future releases, the MVC model may be implemented as well. 
</p>
<br>
<p style='text-align:justify'>
    <b>-&gt</b> The page 'populate_database.php' and all relative files, and the class GitHubLinks and all relative code are all part of the guide system created to demonstrate to project capabilities, thus their programming paradigm and architecture do not fit the one followed by the project.
