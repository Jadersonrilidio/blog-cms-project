# PHP Project - CMS System

	The aim of this project is to deliver a full cms system for a blog-like website with procedural programming language based mainly on PHP.
The HTML/CSS layout was taken from a PHP course available on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/php-for-complete-beginners-includes-msql-object-oriented) and therefore improved by me for the sake of learning.

	Take attention that this project is still in progress, and all features might be changed/improved and many new others added, as well as code-refactoring and OOP-architecture may be implemented in future commits on the master branch.
	
	A more detailed description will be write as soon as possible, and if better a sucint documentation of the project will be set for visitors.
